# Hate Speech Detection in Tweets

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect hate speech in tweets. For simplicity, we define hate speech as tweets with a racist or sexist sentiment. The task involves classifying tweets into two categories: '1' for racist/sexist tweets and '0' for non-racist/non-sexist tweets.

## Dataset

The training dataset consists of labeled tweets where '1' denotes the presence of hate speech, and '0' denotes the absence. The model is trained on this dataset to learn patterns associated with hate speech.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The training dataset is collected, containing labeled tweets.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Text data is preprocessed, including tasks such as lowercasing, tokenization, and removal of stop words and special characters.

3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Text features are extracted using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.

4. **Model Training:**
   - A machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or deep learning) is trained on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation set to ensure generalization.

6. **Model Deployment:**
   - Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data.
